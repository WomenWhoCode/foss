foss (free open source software)
====
Our purpose is to create an easily editable guide for new contributors to free/open source software.

No more commits should be made to the <q>master</q> branch of this repo.  All editing should be done on the <q>gh-pages</q> branch as that is the branch that compiles to the  [womenwhocode.github.io/foss](http://womenwhocode.github.io/foss) website.  

See [GitHub Pages Basics](https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles) for more information.
