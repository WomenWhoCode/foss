foss (free open source software)
====
Our purpose is to create an easily editable guide for new contributors to free/open source software.

All editing should be done on the <q>gh-pages</q> branch as that is the branch that compiles to the  [womenwhocode.github.io/foss](http://womenwhocode.github.io/foss) website.  

The only commits to <q>master</q> should be to README.md to keep it in sync with the README.md on <q>gh-pages</q>.
